  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    I was attending the conference for the second time, admiring the diversity of the speakers and self expression of the audience.
    I walked around in awe, smitten by the inclusiveness of the community and the equality of participation, until I popped into 
    the open spaces.  Open spaces suddenly felt like the old familiar male-dominated office. In a conference of equal representation,
    for every seventy men in attendance at the open spaces, there were only  2 or 3 women.  What gives, I asked myself?  
    Where are the rest of the women?
  </p><p>
    I have a degree in Computer Science, and I spent 20 years of my career writing code and mentoring others. 
    I am also a parent to two girls, and like most parents who code, I had my fair share of disappointments with computer education
    offered by our schools.  After trying and observing several other programs, I had no choice but to start my own, targeting very
    young audience - 7-9 year old girls.  Luckily, a group of my daughter's friends and their parents agreed to give it a try.
  </p>

  <h2>Considerations and resources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Physical space.  Can be a study room at library, or living room at a home.  I chose my home because this are my friends.
    </li>
    <li>
      Physical devices.  Children in my group had access to computers and/or tablets.  If that is not the case, library resources 
must be reserved.  First lesson does not need a computer, so this discussion can happen during the first meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Software resources.  Children in my group had access to variety of devices ranging from tablets and chromebook, to their 
parents' mac and windows computers.  Solving crossplatform installation issues should not be part of this segment. Ideally use
a web resource that works across platforms.  I selected Scratch.
    </li>
    <li>Introductory games will be selected based on what's at hand.  In my case we made sandwitches as TA wrote down an algorithm
    on the board, and we used a  <a href="http://www.robotturtles.com/">Robot Turtle board game</a>, which I already owned.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>One hour before the lesson</h2>
  <p>
    This is real.
    The girls will arrive in an hour, and I’m frantically running through the checklist in my head.  
    What do I have?  What do I still need?  
    Food for sandwiches - check!
    Robot turtles game - check!
    Dry erase board!  I need dry erase board and markers!
    Dry erase board can be substituted with an easel or a large paper pinned to the wall.
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson plan<h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Introductions and goal setting for the lesson
      </li>
      <li>
        Sandwich game to cover fundamentals
      </li>
      <li>
        Reinforcement of fundamentals with the robot turtle game
      </li>
      <li>
        After parents come to pick up the children, discuss what physical devices are available to children, and whether they will be able to use them for a duration of the class.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Actual lesson</h2>
    <p>
      Whew!  It was a wild ride.
    </p><p>
      Sandwiches were too real and dominated the minds.  Great success, though.  Girls were very entertained by me dumping packaged bread on the plate, or by “taking it out” all at once.  We legit ran out of supplies.  Crazy! Everyone were shouting instructions, and I was following them verbatim.  After the first sandwich was made, second one was requested, then the third and the fourth.  We made small variations with lettuce and mayo, but other than that the sandwiches were uniform.
    </p><p>
    I requested the girls to share their observations, the consensus was: instructions have to be specific.  Another observation was brought in by my TA, and introduced the concept of assumption.  When we talk to a human, we assume a lot of small steps will be taken without us specifying them, but we can’t make those assumption when we work with a computer.
    </p><p>
    Then one of the girls brought up loops.  I am not an experienced teacher, and was happy to pick up on the idea and expand it.  We went into conditionals, and that’s where I lost some of my crew.  We wrapped it up and moved on to play Turtles.
    </p><p>
      Turtles is a very simple game, which is easy to learn and set up.  It is designed for a very young audience, even suitable for preschoolers.  However, despite simplicity, it nicely reinforces the concepts.  We had good time playing it, and no one has complained.

<h2>Takeaways<h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All of the kids were different personality and in a different places.  All very smart, though.  And most have done some stuff of this nature before.
    </li>
    <li>
        Need to establish hand raising procedure and class structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Share lesson plan with TA ahead of time.  Don’t go on tangents.
    </li>
    <li>
      Maybe sandwich is more advanced, and should have been introduced after the turtles.  Idea of loops was introduced too early, and so was the conditionals, which should not have been introduced.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tangents are the enemy.  Need to keep always talking, and always on point.
    </li>
    <li>
      The more detailed is the lesson plan, the less time I will spend doing the retro!
    </li>
  </ul>
