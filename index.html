    This is an 8 week programming course taught to a very young audience (7-9 years old)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Pilot group received their instructions over the summer of 2018.  This page is the place to keep course material as I am developing it.

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    In 2018 I was attending the <a href="https://www.pycon.org/">Pycon Conference</a> for my second time, admiring the diversity of the speakers and self expression of the audience.
    I walked around in awe, smitten by the inclusiveness of the community and the equality of participation, until I popped into 
    the open spaces.  Open spaces suddenly felt like the old familiar male-dominated office. In a conference of equal representation,
    for every seventy men in attendance at the open spaces, there were only  2 or 3 women.  What gives, I asked myself?  
    Where are the rest of the women?
  </p><p>
    I have a degree in Computer Science, and I spent 20 years of my career writing code and mentoring others. 
    Over the years, whenever I met a fellow female developer, I asked them what influenced thir decision to become software developer.
    Most of the time, it was an influential adult who believed in them, who pushed them, who served as role model, 
    and simply made sure they can do it.
    I am not an educator by training, but I am also a parent to two girls, and I want them to have their options open.
    Also, like most parents who code, I had my fair share of disappointments with computer education offered by our schools.  
    After trying and observing several other programs, I had decided to start my own, targeting very
    young audience - 7-9 year old girls.  Luckily, a group of my daughter's friends and their parents agreed to give it a try.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating this program, I wanted to address a certain set of problems that I believe are the greatest barriers for young female programmers.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Budget constraint - not everyone has access to the technology necessary to delve fully into coding
      </li>
      <li>
        Time constraint: I decided I wouldnâ€™t assume that my kids would be back the following week. I had to give them a reason to do so. 
      </li>
      <li>
        At each lesson I wanted to give my girls new tools to explore coding on their own, creating projects relevant to their proficiency level. 
      </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Considerations and resources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Physical space.  Can be a study room at library, or living room at a home.  I chose my home because this are my friends.
    </li>
    <li>
      Physical devices.  Children in my group had access to computers and/or tablets.  If that is not the case, library resources must be reserved.  First lesson does not need a computer, so this discussion can happen during the first meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Software resources.  Children in my group had access to variety of devices ranging from tablets and chromebook, to their parents' mac and windows computers.  Solving crossplatform installation issues should not be part of this segment. Ideally use a web resource that  works across platforms.  I selected Scratch.  Note: I am not an expert on how this program works, but it does provide a necessary abstraction from the syntax of a particular language, and gives girls a chance to focus on the concepts, which they will later apply to learning Python programming language.
    </li>
    <li>Introductory games will be selected based on what's at hand.  In my case we made sandwitches as TA wrote down an algorithm
    on the board, and we used a  <a href="http://www.robotturtles.com/">Robot Turtle board game</a>, which I already owned.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructor's cheat sheet</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
          Not every child will be engaged in the same way. Although coding is not for everyone, it is your responsibility to adapt the material in a way that engages as many kids as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each group of children will be different. They may go faster or slower than the lesson you planned. Be prepared to regroup on the fly.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is easy to overwhelm the children. Keep it slow, but interesting. It is okay to go slow down and revisit concepts.  These concepts are fundamental, and kids should never feel overwhelmed.  The better they learn them now, the more opportunities you will have to apply them together in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't get too encouraged by your group members conversationally mention big technical terms.  It is great that they heard of them, and it is even better that they are trying to impress you.  But unless you are sure that the concept is completely understood, don't speed up.  You are running a risk of losing the very person who casually introduced the concept into the conversation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unless you are running this program through the elementary school district, set up a reliable communication channel with parents.  Try to establish a feedback loop to see how children are responding to the instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Focus on all the children in the group, not just the ones that are better responding to your instructions, and want to learn more faster.  Try to recruit a TA, or keep the class very small, 3-5 people is ideal size.  Challenge the top performers with an optional extra assignment, but be sure to explain it to all at the end of the class, so that other children can try it at home.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each new lesson should give the kids new tools to play with, if they desire to do so.  One of my students started doing independent project after lesson 2 while others were reluctant to try independent projects at al.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you feel comfortable, dedicate one class entirely to the children's questions and demos, but have a project handy in case you end up with extra time.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Lessons</h2>
  <p>
    At this point everything is in there - a recording of what I planned, and how the lessons really went.  While the program was in an active phase, I kept notes for the future in a google doc, which I shared my TA. I have started to put together a cleaned up lesson plan, but I still highly recommend to keep both projected and actual plans during the program.
