  <h2>Lesson Plan</h2>
  <p>
    After receiving negative feedback I am careful not to rush.  Rushing discourages students.  Remarkably, the girl who reported to be overwhelmed and wanted to quit, is also doing independent projects on the side.  I am going to encourage her to showcase her work.
    This lesson has no plan.  Instead, the floor will be opened up to everyone to share their individual work and ask any questions they may have for me.
    If (and only if) we have time at the end, we may work some more on the calculator project.  This is my backup plan.

  <h2>Actual lesson</h2>
  <p>
    I started with opening the floor to the individual demonstrations.  Since not everyone did individual work, it is important to keep it balanced - encourage those who did venture out to do more, and at the same time motivate the ones that did not create their own work.  We took turns connecting laptops to TV screen and showcased the projects. This activity was received very well by the entire class.  We admired the projects together, and then reviewed the code to see how they were done.

    After the girls showed their projects, I asked if there were questions about the material covered in previous lessons.  I expected some confusion, but no questions were asked.  I assumed that confusion was too deep to formulate a specific question, and went ahead and revisited the concept of a variable.  Variables are abstract and not immediately clear to such young audience.  I was glad I did it, since it was clearly necessary, and this time was also well received.  It also provided a good segue back into the calculator project.  This time it went a lot faster, and we were able to complete it.
