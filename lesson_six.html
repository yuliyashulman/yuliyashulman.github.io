    After the epic fiasco of lesson 3, I was able to fall into a rhythm that the girls were able to follow.
  </p>
  <h2>Lesson plan</h2>
    <p>
      Introducing conditional statements and the concept of boundary conditions.
    </p><p>
      We will create a project that will ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 5.  
      For each of the user responses, the sprite will declare a "profecy" - a fun phrase intended for the user.
      If the user provides an out of bound number (less than 1, or greater than 5), the default profecy will be rendered:
      "I asked for a number between 1 and 5.  I see a lot of studying in your future"

  <h2>Actual lesson</a>
  <p>
    The girls really liked to showcase their work, so I made a decision that each lesson is going to start with them sharing independent work on a big screen.  It is great fun and inspiration to everybody, and also gave me a glimpse into what concepts kids did not completely grasp.  I uncovered some confusion between costume and sprite, which I made sure to clear up.

    Actual lesson was received very well.  Children had great time coming up with silly prophecies.  
    Not everyone liked the sprite of a witch, and chose different ones for themselves.  Some girls changed sprite's costumes between rendering specific profecies.
    Conditionals as a concept was a lot more familiar to the girls.
