  <h2>Dream Lesson Plan - DO NOT USE</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Let’s open our editors and click on ‘create’.  We are now in the programming space.  On the top left is our program’s output.  One the bottom left is our sprite.  And on the right is the area where we will create our program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Notice the list of various blocks in the middle of the screen.  Let’s focus on them for a little while.
  </li>
  <li>
    On a fresh project introducing ‘move 10 steps’ and return to 0,0 coordinates.  Introducing motion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introducing costumes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introducing resetting of the sprite to its original position.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introducing sensing menu and a concept of interactive user input.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introducing variables. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Putting it all together:
    Now that we are somewhat familiar with how this works, let us create something more complex, a calculator.  Initially we will focus just on additions.  Demo a calculator, will create it in our next lesson.

  <h2>More realistic Lesson Plan</h2>
  <p>
    This lesson is for the introduction to the Scratch application, and an idea of how to give a program the instructions.  For expediency I requested the parents of my students to register with Scratch, and to bring laptops to class.
    Instruction is a very abstract idea, which includes multiple categories.  Scratch breaks it down in a specific way, and we are going to walk through several simple exercises to learn the application specific “language”.  Reference back to the games we played during the previous lesson, with a focus on the idea of instructions.  Every software development language has to be learned.  It has its unique syntax and concepts.  Today we focus on the language of Scratch.
  </p><p>
    Scratch is a visual editor application.  Every instruction comes in a form of blocks, that are applied to a sprite.  What is sprite?  Sprite is a figure that are are going to work with.

  <h2>Actual lesson</h2>
  <p>
    My group was a little too young for the knowledge of coordinate system.  I went back to the drawing board to explain coordinates as a concept.  Then we went through the exercise of exploring the size of the Scratch drawing space and the motion function.  In scratch the sprite always moves forward.  In order to make the sprite move in a different direction, the sprite needs to turn.
    We created a project where the default sprite (cat) is moving around the screen, pausing for 1 second on every corner.  Pseudocode:
  </p>
  <p>
    In a forever loop:</br>
    Move to the lower left coordinates</br>
    Turn right</br>
    Sleep 1 second</br>
    Move to the lower left coordinates</br>
    Turn up</br>
    Sleep 1 second</br>
    Move to the upper right coordinates</br>
    Turn left</br>
    Sleep 1 second</br>
    Move to the upper left coordinates</br>
    Turn down</br>
    Sleep 1</br>

<b>Brag of the day:</b> One of the girls went home and started working on her own project!  Her mom was very excited and shared a video with me.
