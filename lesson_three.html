  <h2>Dream Lesson Plan - DO NOT USE</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      First let’s recap on things we covered during previous lesson: instructions, coordinates, movement direction, and the “forever loop”.
    </li>
    <li>
      By way of introducing a variable into a familiar context, we will add a loop counter to the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/235832020/">project</a> from Lesson 2
    </li>
    <li>
      Loop counter is a variable.  It stores values of the number of loops the cat circled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-examine various components of the program that we just wrote paying emphasis on those concepts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Shift focus to the sprite.  Introduce costumes.  Expand the project to have cat change costumes at certain points.
    </li>
    <li>
      Start new project - calculator.
    </li>
    <li>
      Introducing user input.
    </li>
    <li>
      Introducing saving input to a variable
    </li>
    <li>
      Introducing operations on the variables - finally Calculator Phase 1.
    </li>
  </ol>

  Challenge:  How do you explain a variable to a young audience?  Maybe the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/intro-to-variables">video</a> in the link above will work.

  <h2>Why not, or the Actual Lesson</h2>
  <p>
    Review went okay, I showed coordinates again, putting coordinate grid on the background of the screen.  This helped with visualization.
  </p><p>
    Then I explained the variables.  Khan academy video confused the girls.  Children were completely unprepared for the format of the information presented, and I almost lost them.  We quickly regrouped and shown bucket, called it a variable, and started putting different things in it.  Those were values.  Bucket was a named placeholder for the values.  This was more clear.
  </p><p>
    Then we started putting together a calculator project.  First we created a new project.  It has cat sprite by default, which we deleted.  We did not pick a new sprite, instead we attached code to the canvas.  We created a little bit of code to take user input and store it into variables, and outputting sum into the result.  We did not go beyond summation, as there was a lot of confusion, and we had to go over concepts multiple times.  It was hands down the bumpiest lesson, but I could not quite put my finger as to why.

  </p><p>
    Luckily, my test audience is comprised of my friends, who are not shy about giving feedback.  This time it was negative.  One girl described it as too technical, but I did not get a sense that she was lost during the lesson.  Looking back I see that too many new concepts were introduced too fast, and the lesson was overwhelming for the young audience.  I was lucky I was able to fix this mistake before it was too late, and the girl did not lose her interest.
  </p><p>
    Takeaway:  don't rush.  These concepts are fundamental, and the girls need time to absorb and process. Revisit next lesson format.  
  </p>

  <h2>Recommended Lesson Plan</h2>
  <p>
    Dedicate the lesson to explaining the user input and create a project using graphics and interractions.
    If time permists, introduct loop counter.
  </p><p>
  <b>Brag of the day:</b> By this point, some of the girls started programming at home on their own.  The ones who ventured into exploratory work were eager to share it. So I decided to slow down, turn the table, and let the girls drive the next lesson.
