    The last lesson of the series.  
    I was tempted to tech the girls about functions and data structures, but decided to end on a high note, and give them a safe space to experiment.
    By this point, most of the girls have been exploring on their own, but they were not equaly comfortable at doing so.

  <h2>Lesson plan</h2>
  <p>
    As it became our custom, the lesson began with the demonstration of my student's independent work.  
    At this point most girls prepared a project to showcase.

    Then we moved on to the material I wanted to cover in class.
    This project's idea I borrowed from google.  I wanted to have something unified enough to be a group activity, but different
    enough, to facilitate independent thinking.  Animating the letters of the name seems like a great find.
    We each ended up with different letters, and different tricks, but we did share the ideas and looked at each other's code.

  <h2>Actual lesson</h2>
  <p>
    Actual lesson went as planned.  It undescored how much the girls have learned as programmers, and how much I've learned as a teacher.
    It took us a lot longer than 8 weeks, because of the travel plans, and family circumstances, but we did get here.
    By now school has already started, and we need to take a break, which will also give me a chance to think of a new project.
    The girls are all eager to continue.
    I want to move away from scratch, but have to dedicate some research to unifying their development environment.
