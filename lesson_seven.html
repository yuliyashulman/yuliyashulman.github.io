  <h2>Lesson plan</h2>
    <p>
      Two lessons earlier, during the demonstration of independent work, One of my students asked to help her debug a strange behavior.
      While examining her code, I noticed that she attached her code to a wrong object.  I showed her the mistake, and she was able to correct it, but repeated it again later.
      I felt this was a good oportunity to talk about access and scope.
  </p><p>
    Scope is a big word to describe visibility in relation to an object.  In our case, we discussed visibility of variables in relation to sprites.
    Scratch does not provide any shared context, so every variable, function, or block of code belong to a sprite, or to everyone.
    We explored these concepts by introducing 2 sprintes, a butterfly and a bat, each keeping track of the sum of the numbers given to them.  
    We achieved that by clicking on a sprite, and then creating a variable, indicating that it belongs to this sprite.
    We also created a global sum tracker, which belonged to all sprites, and tracked every number entered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Important, when you look at the sprite inside the project, you can only see the variables that belong to this sprite or to all sprites.
    Variables that do not belong to a particular sprite will not be accessible.  This is what visibility means.
  <h2>Actual lesson</h2>
    <p>
      My TA went back to college, and a new TA had to step in.  This changed the class dynamics a little, as we were all learning to work together.

    Scope is rather abstract concept, so I made sure to go slow, giving the girls a chance to explore and absorb the nuances of accessibility rule.
